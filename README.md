# Communication between a computer and a STM32F401RTB chip through serial port com

The repository is separated in 3 subfolders:

- Python scripts to control the chip through serial com
- STMCubeIDE project files to compile bin file to flash stm32 chip (CubeIDE version 1.12.1)
- Openocd flashing configuration files

Look into the Python files to get an overview of the commands and how they work.

To compile the bin file yourself, you need STM32CubeIDE or STM32CubeCLT.
